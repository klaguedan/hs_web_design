              Brush pens: they're just pens with brush tips. Although, I find that regular markers with flexible tips work just as well.

          Brush Calligraphy

          The photo above is the title of one of my notes for history. I don't always do the titles in calligraphy, but they're a nice touch when I have free time. I honestly feel that, between the two styles I know how to write in, brush has to be the more difficult one. It requires a lot of hand control and very smooth changes in hand pressure. Notice that in this style, there's a lot of line variation. The downstrokes are thicker while the upstrokes are lighter.

          Gothic Calligraphy
        </h3>

        <img class="article-img" alt="My name in gothic calligraphy" src="images/example-calligraphy-gothic.jpg"/>

        <p class="article-text">
          In contrast to brush calligraphy, gothic calligraphy's lines are of equal thickness. In my opinion, it gives it that old fashioned, serious aesthetic. I mention that it's easier and this is because you don't really have to worry about writing with more or less pressure at some parts. All that matters is that you keep the pen's nib at a consistent angle while writing letters.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          With this said however, learning how to write the letters can be quite difficult in any type of calligraphy. Especially since there are an infinite amount of different styles to learn. With just the two styles I know though, I'm able to add a little bit more stylishness with anything I can write on.
