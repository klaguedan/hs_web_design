          Finding Music
        </h2>

        <p class="definition">
          Browsing several music platforms for unknown artists, songs, and genres.
        </p>

        <h3 class="article-heading">
          How did I start?
        </h3>

        <p class="article-text">
          Listening to music is a big part of my life. At home, I'm most likely always listening to music or watching YouTube videos in my free time. There are so many genres that I want to explore and countless songs that I want to discover. Ever since I had access to the internet and music streaming services, I've dedicated quite a lot of time finding new tunes. In fact, it is June 3rd as I'm writing this and below is a measure of how much music I've listened to. It's about 4 hours per day!
        </p>

        <img class="article-img" alt="I've spent 1,532 minutes since May 26th listening to music" src="images/example-music-time.jpg"/>

        <p class="article-text">
          I can't quite put a specific label on my music taste since it's very eclectic. It always changes depending on my mood and depending on the occasion.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          Music is an often underestimated way to practice a language. With lyrics, it's essentially recognition training. The more you get used to hearing a language, the easier it becomes understanding native speakers. This was the case when I wanted to learn Japanese. I was introduced to J-Pop way before, but I realized that I could listen to catchy songs while brushing up my skills. It was like passive studying.

          What I Look for in a Song
        </h3>

        <p class="article-text">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Interesting structure
            </li>

            <li>
              Catchy and unique melody
            </li>

            <li>
              Good vocals
            </li>

            <li>
              Cool harmonies
            </li>

            <li>
              Combination of instruments
            </li>

            <li>
              Production quality
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          Of course, not every song I listen to is rigidly defined by those standards. Like I said, my music taste is very sporadic so it's hard for even me to pinpoint why exactly I like the songs that I do.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          In the simplest sense, I like most songs because there's always one aspect that I find beautiful and memorable.
