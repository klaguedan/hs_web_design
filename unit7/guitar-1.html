          My Start With Guitar
        </h2>

        <p class="definition">
          Traditionally a 6-stringed instrument which can be picked or plucked. Technological advancements have altered modern guitars and the sounds they can produce.

        <h3 class="article-heading">
          How did I start?
        </h3>

        <p class="article-text">
          Ever since I was young, I've always enjoyed dabbling with various instruments. The first instrument I ever got serious about was the violin, but now I like to practice guitar. Now that I think about it, I enjoy stringed instruments much more such as the ukulele and others. The sound that they produce is very bright and I've always thought it was cool how sound effects could be added to the guitar depending on the style of music being played.

          Free Guitars
        </h3>

        <p class="article-text">
          I practice for about an hour a day, but the funny thing is that I haven't bought any of the guitars that I use. One of my friends gave me an electric guitar and another one of my friends no longer uses her acoustic one.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          One day if I save up enough money or if my family decides to surprise me, I'd like to pick out my own guitar. I feel as if having one that I choose from many different options would boost my confidence and motivation.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          My plans are to eventually have my own acoustic and electric guitar. I practice more often on an electric guitar, which is said to be much easier on fingers compared to acoustic, so hopefully I can get used to both.
        </p>

        <p class="article-text">
          Just like with calligraphy, it surprises me that yet another hobby I've picked up was the result of very lucky opportunities.
