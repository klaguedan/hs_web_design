              I was a lot more chaotic in elementary school because I may have had some brainpower, but that doesn't mean that I'd used it for good.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              My memories of this era are foggy, but I had a pizza party for my birthday in kindergarten. Having these celebrations was a big deal since the unanimous favorite food was pizza back then. It's funny how quickly your popularity can skyrocket by just feeding people.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              In the first grade, I visited the Philippines again. I got to attend school there for a little bit and it was very different from what I was used to. I also struggled a little bit because at this point, I was no longer proficient in understanding Ilocano or Tagalog.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              In second grade I got glasses after one of the teachers kept pestering me about how much I'd always squint to see the board. I'm thankful for it now though, my eyesight is horrible.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              I moved schools the summer before third grade. Initially, I was pretty mad at my mom and aunt since I didn't want to move, but I got over it.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              Besides, I didn't have to worry about being the "new kid" because the entire school was new. This, at least, was a source of comfort. I played several pranks, but I never got caught because I was still technicallly the "goody two-shoes."
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              In one prank, I altered the input settings of my teacher's new projector so that when they tried to project something, all that showed was a blue screen. My teacher tried getting assistance from a neighboring class, but during the time they'd left, I'd switch the settings back to normal. This way, there would be nothing to fix and the other teacher would have been called over for nothing. I can't recall my exact motivations for this, and I probably still can't pinpoint any plausible motives, but in my defense, the teacher should've figured out that the switch wasn't flipped to the right input. Not everyone can be a tech wizard I guess.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              In fourth grade, I started playing the violin which I continued throughout 5th grade. It was an after-school program at school and we even got to perform at theaters throughout the city!
