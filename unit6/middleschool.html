              Middle school was a pleasant experience for me because I was surrounded by supportive classmates.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              I honed my artistic skills with classes such as:
              <ul class="paragraph-font">
                <li>Speech and Drama (6th Grade)</li>

                <li>Art (8th Grade)</li>

                <li>Choir (7th, 9th, and 10th Grade)</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              It felt weird transitioning to 6th grade because there was a surge of new students at my school. I pretty much had to familiarize myself with everyone again. Thankfully, each one of my class periods had the same group of people so it was very easy to get acquainted.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              Growing up was worth it though. My mom and sister had presented me with my own computer to use for school. I'd use it to play video games and talk to friends too though.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              In 7th grade, I got my own phone but it had very little storage so I couldn't have pages filled with fun apps. Creating group chats with friends and listening to music through an app was fun. It was around this time that I had my emo phase and my habit of wearing only black began.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-font">
              In the 8th grade, I started developing an interest in and studying for math. It was a single night's impulse, really. All of a sudden I told myself to understand the math I'd been struggling with (Algebra). I figured that it was about time I became excellent at something. And so, I revisited my old Khan Academy account and taught myself the majority of topics I know today. Extra studying also helped me get ahead in class and help others.
